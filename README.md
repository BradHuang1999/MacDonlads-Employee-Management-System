12AP CompSci Project

Objective: Use Java Object-Oriented Programming to create an employee management and scheduling system for MacDonlads.

Introduction: MacDonlads Burger Restaurant is finally getting a computer system! They have hired you to build their  employee scheduling system. During this co-op placement (they donâ€™t want to pay you) you are  responsible for building a program that allows the restaurant owner to manage various types of  employees, assign them weekly schedules, and calculate their weekly pay check. (McDonlads pays  employees in cash at the end of every week)

Details: Using all object oriented concepts discussed in the course thus far, you are to design a console based system that fulfills the requirements below. The design of your system should be carefully planned to apply object oriented concepts to build the system in a way that it mimics real-life. An elegant solution will receive top marks.
